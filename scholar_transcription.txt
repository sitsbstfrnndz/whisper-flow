 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I believe in delivering what I always promise. Then you'll say after the event, I apologize for saying that you should guess and show what you did. Now I say what I am proud of is that I maintain a good relationship because after even apologizing to this guy in Spain in a situation we had a personal coffee chat with him and then I followed up and then we made a good pressure because he invited me for interview. He did this on that. Yeah. What I learned is that a mistake, a mistake is not a stumbling block but can always be turned into opportunity. Damn. Then it'll be like, in this case, it was an opportunity for me to build even better goodwill. But your brain ends up. Yeah. But I mean, you can't bring out the brain entry. But... This bar is... And then that's it. You see that? I'm proud to say that. I believe I made even stronger pressure on him. And we still stay in contact today and he's not my mentor. Then you can see, okay, he actually had some problems. Like that's the evidence, like, actually... Damn, bro.
